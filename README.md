# Introduction to Lightning Web Components

I created this github repository to save all the practical work done while learning the lightning web components. I am using this repository to keep track of my progress, and to have a public portfolio to showcase my work. I am also sharing this repository with my colleagues, so that we can work together on these projects.

## What this repo contains?

This repository will include notes, code snippets and components created during this process. It will also serve as a reference for future projects.

#### I plan to update this repository regularly to keep track of my progress and development.
